# Overview: 
The Simple Calculator program is a Java application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers and select one of four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The program executes the selected operation and displays the result. It includes error handling for invalid choices and division by zero.

# Key Activities
# 1. User Input:
The program prompts the user to enter two numerical values (num1 and num2).
Ensures smooth data collection with clear instructions and separation of steps.

# 2. Operation Selection:
Offers a menu of four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Prompts the user to choose an operation by entering a corresponding number (1-4).

# 3. Computation:
Utilizes a switch statement to match the user's choice with the appropriate arithmetic operation.
Includes error handling for invalid choices and division by zero.

# 4. Output Display:
Displays the result of the selected operation.
Outputs an error message if the user attempts to divide by zero or selects an invalid operation.

# Technology Used
# 1. Java Programming Language: 
Core functionality implemented using basic Java constructs like Scanner, switch, and conditional statements.

# 2. Java Standard Library:
java.util.Scanner for reading user inputs from the console.

# Key Insights
# 1. Modular Design:
The program is well-structured, with distinct sections for input, operation selection, computation, and output.

# 2. User-Friendly Interaction:
Clear prompts and separation of steps using visual markers (e.g., System.out.println("-------------------------------------")) enhance readability.

# 3. Error Handling:
Ensures division by zero is gracefully handled with an error message.
Validates user choice to prevent incorrect operations.

# 4. Scalability:
The program is easy to extend, allowing for the addition of more operations or features in the future.
